        <h3>Designed for the Internet of Things</h3>
        <p>Asteroid makes connecting embedded devices to the Internet extremely easy and helps write global programs that are distributed between several devices and a cloud.</p>

        <img src="/img/20-gear-2.png" class="bs-icon">
        <h3>One programming language</h3>
        <p>Write programs for the Raspberry Pi, Arduinos and other <a href="#">supported devices</a> with only one programming language.<br/>And of course your server logic is also JavaScript!</p>
      </div>

        <img src="/img/58-wifi.png" class="bs-icon">
        <h3>More than a framework</h3>
        <p>Asteroid is also a platform that helps you connect and monitor your device, control and distribute your code and facilitate exchange with other devices or services.<br/>Of course, Asteroid is completely free and licensed under the MIT License so that you will never depend on one company to run your service!</p>

        <h3>1. Connect</h3>
        <p>Download a client for your <a>supported device</a> and follow our instructions to install it.<br/>
          You will be connected to Asteroid in a few minutes only!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="span4">
        <h3>2. Program</h3>
        <p>Asteroid comes with a full set of programs you can run on your smart device from data collection, interaction with online services or parsing of online data.<br/>
          Of course, you can also write your own.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="span4">
        <h3>3. Run</h3>
        <p>Asteroid deploys your program to your device and runs it.<br/>
           Asteroid will also monitor your device and let you know if anything goes wrong.</p>

      <h1>Why did we build it?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="span12">
        <p>We were building connected objects using Arduinos and Raspberry Pi and realized that there is no elegant framework to quickly work on distributed projects where the logic is spread between the device and a cloud service.</p>
        <p>Asteroid addresses those challenges and lets you develop both the server and the client, together and with only one modern and powerful language: JavaScript.</p>

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Supported devices</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="span6">
        <h3>Asteroid is already compatible with...</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Arduino family: The programs are run on the server side</li>
            <li>Raspberry Pis: Programs can be distributed between the server and the client</li>
            <li>Loochi lamp: Loochi is a high-power colored lamp built and distributed by TBideas. Asteroid supports Loochi very well.</li>
          </ul>
          For those devices, you only need to follow our <a>Getting Started</a> guides and your device will be online in no time!

        <h3>Connect your devices to Asteroid</h3>
        <p>Connecting more devices to Asteroid is very easy. You just need to implement the Asteroid client protocol, describe the capabilities of your device that you want to expose in Asteroid and write a few functions to connect everything together.</p>
