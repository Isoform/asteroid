# Use-cases

## Planned use-cases

 * User gets a feedback in the console when an exception happened running the code

 * User can write a script that calls require()

 * User can open/edit/save pieces of source code as named-files

 * User can select which code to run on a device and launch it with a button

Small todos:

 * Make sure first screen is home (and not doc)

 * In doc.4: say it's should take less than 5 minutes

 * Check google analytics

 * Check email password recovery


## To be confirmed

 * By default - create a Hello World script for new connected devices

 * User gets a badge when he connects a Raspberry Pi for the first time

 * User gets a feedback in the source editor when the code can not be run because of a syntax error

 * User can select dependencies (require() packages) through checkboxes

 * User can look at an example that shows how to read sounds through the raspberry pi sound card

 * User can look at examples that show how to display graphics on a screen connected to the raspberry pi


# Implemented

 * User can watch the console output in real-time

 * User can look at several code examples
