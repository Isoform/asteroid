  <h2>1. Prepare a Raspbian SD Card</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Download the latest Raspbian image from the official Raspberry Pi site</li>
    <li>Write this image to an SD Card (http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup)
      <br> On a mac:
 <pre>
# Find the identifier of your sd card: disk2 or disk3 probably.
$ diskutil list

# Unmount the disk so that you can erase it
$ sudo diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2

# Use the image that you have downloaded to erase the sd card
$ sudo dd bs=1m if=2013-02-09-wheezy-raspbian.img of=/dev/disk2
 </pre>
      <em>You will have to wait for a little while. You can press Ctrl-T to get a report on how much information has been copied to the card and how fast it is going.</em>
    </li>
    <li>Eject the disk and you are done!</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Boot your new Raspberry Pi</h2>

  <p>Insert the freshly prepared SD card in your Raspberry Pi and plug the power. If you have plugged a screen or a tv, you can watch your Raspberry Pi boot.</p>

  <h2>3. Connect to your Raspberry Pi</h2>
  <p>There are several ways to do this.</p>

  <h3>With a keyboard and a screen</h3>
  <p>Simply login with the username: "pi" and the password "raspberry".</p>

  <h3>Through the network</h3>
  <p>If your Raspberry Pi is plugged to the network via an ethernet cable, you can login with SSH.<br>
    Find your Raspberry Pi IP address (you may have to ping different addresses until you find it, for example if your computer is 192.168.1.3, try 192.168.1.4, 192.168.1.5 etc) and <code>ssh -l pi &lt;pi address&gt;</code>

  <h2>4. Install pi js on your Raspberry Pi</h2>
  <p>Type the following command: <code>curl http://www.pijs.io/install-pijs.sh |bash</code><br>Your Raspberry Pi will download the necessary components, compile them and install them. This may take up to two hours. When done, the pijs client will start automatically.</p>

  <h2>5. Start programming in the cloud!</h2>
  <p>If you have not done so yet, create an account on pijs.io and click on the "Add Device" button. Your Raspberry Pi should automatically appear in the list of available devices. Click on: <button class="btn"><i class="icon-plus-sign"></i></button> and give a name to your Raspberry Pi (like Thomas'Pi or "Pi in the kitchen").<br>
    Use the edit code button to start programming!
